# Azure Terraform Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my Azure + Terraform DevOps project portfolio. Each project here simulates real-world infrastructure deployments using Terraform on Azure, designed to demonstrate my proficiency with cloud, infrastructure-as-code, and GitHub-based documentation.

---

## Terraform Resources

Projects include a variety of Terraform resources such as:

- `azurerm_postgresql_flexible_server`
- `azurerm_virtual_network`
- `azurerm_subnet`
- `azurerm_network_interface`
- `azurerm_linux_virtual_machine`
- `azurerm_load_balancer`
- `azurerm_application_gateway`
- `azurerm_resource_group`

---

## Project Structure

Each project folder includes:

- `main.tf` – core infrastructure logic
- `variables.tf` – configurable inputs
- `outputs.tf` – key results returned from resources
- `provider.tf` – required providers and backend
- `README.md` – explanation of what each project does
- `screenshots/` – embedded Terraform plan results
